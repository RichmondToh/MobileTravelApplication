# MobileTravelApplication
The TravelMate app was designed with a specific purpose to help tourists and people traveling
Australia have access to information about exquisite landmarks, places to visit, places to stay and a
Wishlist which the users themselves can compile. When the app launches the user will be placed in
the welcome screen with two buttons, one goes to the user login page and the other to the
registration page. The user can create an account within the registration page and if the user has
entered a valid email and password which is not shorter than 4 characters or larger than 12
characters the user will then be successfully directed to the login page where they will be able to
login using the account they registered.
